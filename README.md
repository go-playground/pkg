pkg extends the core Go packages with missing or additional functionality built in. All packages correspond to the std go package name with an additional suffix of `ext` to avoid naming conflicts.

## Motivation

This is a place to put common reusable code that is not quite a library but extends upon the core library, or it's failings.

## Install

`go get -u github.com/go-playground/pkg/v5`

## How to Contribute

Make a pull request... can't guarantee it will be added, going to strictly vet what goes in.
